Nuclear Escape
This is our groups 3D game created in 24 hours for the great uni hack 2021. The theme of this year, post-apocalypse.

This is a first person action stealth game, where you are set with the task of traversing a barren post-apocalytpic landscape in search of safety. 

In order to succeed, the player will have to navigate the land without being exposed to radiation, if they are exposed to radiation from the clouds, they will have to find the cure or else it might mean the end of their journey. As well as the radiation clouds, the player will have to look out for a squad of rogue agents that have gone insane from over exposure to radiation and are now out to hunt and kill. 

This game takes the use of Animations and Sound effects, which are royalty free, credits to what and where they are from can be found in the credits.txt file.
